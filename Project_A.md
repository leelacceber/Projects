# Water Reuse System for Crop Wash Station

During my exchange programme at University of California Davis, I took a course involving **Product Design, Building, Testing**, offered by [UC Davis D-Lab] (https://piet.ucdavis.edu/maindlab). In the course, I, along with 2 team members, designed and constructed a product prototype for a real client. Having gone through a complete protoytping process, I have gained understanding in different steps of a design process, and how to create a succesful product. 

## Our Client

Our team's client was a small farm in a nearby city. Initially, the water they used for washing crops would just be drain to the soil. They would like to build a water reuse system at their crop wash station, so that the crop wash water can be reused again after sediment removal, filtration, and UV sanitation.

## Design Criteria

After we got our client's information, we came up with considerations for our design, including technical, social, environmental, and financial considerations, so as to determine how to measure and test our prototype later.

We then made a Testing Table:

|Criteria|Qualitative / Quantitative|Testing Procedure|Target Value|Metric / Functional Unit|Source|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|Water coliform level|Quantitative|Take a sample of the water after the purification process and test it for E. coli|0|colony forming units (cfu) per 100 mL|United States Department of Agriculture|
|Water turbidity|Quantitative|Take a sample of the water after the filtration process and test its turbidity|<5|NTU (nephelometric turbidity unit)|WHO|
|The proportion of water reused|Quantitative|Measure the amount of water that is reused and divide it with the amount of water used for crop wash|>50|%|The water to be reused at least once|
