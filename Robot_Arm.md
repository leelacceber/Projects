**Introduction to Robotics** is a hands-on course offered by CUHK Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering. In the course, I learnt about motion planning, kinematics, and dynamics of robotic systems, with help of a real [robotic arm](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/features/darwin-lau.html). We were also tasked to come up with and demonstrate an innovative idea for the use of the robotic arm, so that we could apply what we learnt in a practical scenario. 

## idea
I, along with 2 team members, decided to use the robot arm to fold clothes. 
then change to mini-shirt

## calibration

## end effector
3d print

## set up

## trajectory planning
arduino

## inverse kinematics
