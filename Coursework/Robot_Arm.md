**Introduction to Robotics** is a hands-on course offered by CUHK Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering. In the course, I learnt about motion planning, kinematics, and dynamics of robotic systems, with help of a real [robotic arm](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/features/darwin-lau.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. We were also tasked to come up with and demonstrate an innovative idea for the use of the robotic arm, so that we could apply what we learnt in a practical scenario. 

## idea
I, along with 2 team members, decided to use the robot arm to fold clothes. Since the power the robot arm's motor is not enough, we decided to demonstrate using a mini-shirt.
